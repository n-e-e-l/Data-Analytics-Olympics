Enclosed in this folder are all data analytics done on a real-world Olympic dataset as well as visualizations. <br />
Deployed for interactive usage: https://data-analytics-olympics.herokuapp.com/

# Tl;dr
A project exploring a real Olympic dataset from 1896 to 2016.<br />
Goal: Get detailed insight into the country, sports & Olympic events in an interactive way.

# Introduction
In this notebook, we will mainly use Pandas and Plotly to generate insights about the Medal tally of all the countries over the years, the performance of the country in an event, and insights about the various athletic events at Olympics. We finish up with deploying the project for interactive usage.

# Distribution of age for various sports
The long curve indicate the probability of athlete having a chance to win a medal is quite long as seen in art comptetions which were officially part of olympics from 1912 to 1948 but something like gymastics the age range is qute small hence steep curve can be observed. This also gives insight about how long a athelte career in a sports is usually.
