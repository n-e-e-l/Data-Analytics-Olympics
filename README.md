# Tl;dr
A project exploring a real Olympic dataset from 1896 to 2016.<br />
Goal: Get detailed insight into the country, sports & Olympic events in an interactive way

# Introduction
In this notebook, we will mainly use Pandas and Plotly to generate insights about the Medal tally of all the countries over the years, the performance of the country in an event, and insights about the various athletic events at Olympics. We finish up with deploying the project for interactive usage.
